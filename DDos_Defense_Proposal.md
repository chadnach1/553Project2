Now, you should read all parts of the project (especially Part 4) to learn the requirements for the DDoS defense and evaluation and use that to plan your development.  It is also highly recommended that you start part 4 of the project while working on the proposal.  Your document should include:
— a description of your proposed solution, including initial design decisions, diagram of system components, diagram and/or pseudo-code showing system behavior, communication protocols/messages sent between parts of your system, etc.
— a description of your proposed experiments and expected results to validate your solution
